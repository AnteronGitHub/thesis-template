\section{Dryad}
Dryad was a Microsoft project which developed systems for distributed data-parallel execution
engines. Their prototype used dataflow graphs presentation for computations. Instead of application-level datasets, the
system used shared memory FIFOs. While Spark was not evaluated against this prototype, the Dryad project has since been
discontinued, and their focus has been shifted towards Apache Hadoop.

\section{Pregel}
Pregel is another cluster implementation. It also uses a graph-based representation for
computations. In contrast to Spark and Dryad, Pregel focuses on processing of graph-represented data. Its is more
restrictive than RDDs, which can make some applications simpler to implement, but it trades off generality. However,
graph based models are widely used, and they were also one of the motivations for MapReduce framework.
