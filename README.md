#  Thesis templates
## University of Helsinki, Faculty of Science, Department of Computer Science

This repository is meant for the internal maintenance of the thesis templates.

If you want to make changes to the template, then notify first the CSM board at csm-templates@helsinki.fi.

*Note:* All instructions for the use of templates will gradually be moved from this repository to the webpages of the BSc or MSc programs.

* MSc Students: For your MSc thesis, refer to the [MSc Thesis webpage](https://courses.helsinki.fi/en/csm11005/) for instructions.
* BSc Students: For your BSc thesis, find basic instructions [here](https://version.helsinki.fi/cs/thesis-template/-/blob/92ea603516d9e2d3899b76b9132017d6230357f7/instructions/bsc-instructions.md).
