While MapReduce framework provides data partitioning, distribution and some level of fault-tolerance, it does not
provide more detailed optimizations. MapReduce is commonly used in other systems, such as Apache Hadoop which includes
an optimised distributed file system, called HDFS. RDDs provide less overhead for data reuse,
at the cost of a more opinionated interface.
