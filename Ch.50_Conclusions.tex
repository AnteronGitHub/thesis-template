In summary, by providing an opinionated dataset interface, Spark provides a more efficient in-memory cluster than the
alternatives discussed. This trade-off is acceptable in use cases that motivated the design of Spark. Since simple API
is a common goal for all of these systems, it will likely end up being a deal-breaker when choosing which to one use.
Still after ten years, both Spark and Hadoop can still be found in the catalogues of the major cloud platforms.
