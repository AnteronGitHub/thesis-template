\chapter{Evaluation\label{results}}

The performance and fault-tolerance of Spark were evaluated in Amazon cloud with system tests and application
benchmarks. Spark showed up to 20 times performance improvements for iterative machine learning application when
compared to regular Apache Hadoop and an in-memory HDFS Hadoop implementations. Additionally Spark showed a 2.4
time speedup for PageRank algorithm compared to regular Hadoop. Spark was able to recover from a single node failure
during a 10 iteration k-means clustering with 50 percent iteration time increase during the node failure. Spark also
showed graceful performance degradation as the amount of available memory for a logistic regression computation was
downscaled.
