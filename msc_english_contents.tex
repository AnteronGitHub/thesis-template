\chapter{Introduction}

The following gives some superficial instructions for using this template for a Master's thesis. For guidelines on thesis writing you can consult various sources, such as university courses on scientific writing or your supervisors.

The thesis should have an introduction chapter. Other chapters can be named according to the topic. In the end, a concluding chapter is needed; see Chapter~\ref{chapter:conclusions} for an example.

\chapter{Figures and Tables}

Besides text, you can use figures and tables in your thesis.

\section{Figures}
Figure~\ref{fig:logo} gives an example how to add figures to the document. 
%
Using figures is particularly useful to display plots of experimental results.

Remember always to cite the figure in the main text. In addition, consider providing the figure with a descriptive caption.

\begin{figure}[h!] 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{HY-logo-ml.png}
\caption{University of Helsinki flame-logo for Faculty of Science.\label{fig:logo}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\section{Tables}

Table~\ref{table:results} gives an example of a table that reports experimental results.

Remember always to cite the table in the main text. 

\begin{table}[t!]
\begin{center}
\caption{Experimental results.\label{table:results}}
\begin{tabular}{l||l c r} 
Experiment & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 
\hline \hline 
$A$ & 2.5 & 4.7 & -11 \\
$B$ & 8.0 & -3.7 & 12.6 \\
$A+B$ & 10.5 & 1.0 & 1.6 \\
\hline
%
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\chapter{References}

It is very likely that, at various points in your thesis, you will need refer to other parts of the thesis or even to other works from the literature.
%
Referring to other parts of the thesis is usually straightforward --- e.g., ``see
Appendix~\ref{appendix:sample} for some additional material'' or ``see Figure~\ref{fig:logo} on page~\pageref{fig:logo}''.

To refer to other works in the literature, make sure you include a ``Bibliography'' chapter after the concluding chapter that lists all the works that you refer to in your text; and that you refer to the works in the bibliography using an appropriate \emph{citation key}.
%
This thesis template contains an example of a bibliography.
%
As an example of a citation key, we can write \citep{einstein} to refer to the work written by Einstein in 1905, as it appears in the bilbliography included in this template.

Note that there are different possible styles for the bibliography and citation keys.
%
You may consult your supervisors on the chosen style -- and once you arrive at a preferred style, use it consistently throughout the thesis.
 
\chapter{Conclusions\label{chapter:conclusions}}

It is good to conclude with a summary of findings. You can also use separate chapter for discussion and future work. These details you can negotiate with your supervisor.
